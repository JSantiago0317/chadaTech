This project was about creating two clocks, one in 12 hour format and the other in 24 hour format, to display side by side with the ability to add hours minutes or seconds. I feel as if I did a good job creating my clock classes and methods associated with those classes. One place I can enhance my code is the functionality of it. A feature I would have liked to add is the ability to also subtract time from the clocks because it would have made the program more useable in the real world. The hardest part of this program to me was resetting the clocks once they went past their 12 or 24 hour limit. It was very challenging to me but I was able to get it after a lot of trial and error. Stackoverflow and google had to be my top resources because without being able to look at others code, I don't know if I would've been able to finish this project. The ability to learn how to not only write a base class but to also extend those classes as I did with the clock and the extended 12 and 24 hour versions of that class. To make this program more readable and adaptable, I tried to create good functions, use whitespace where it made sense and I also tried to comment as thoroughly as possible.
